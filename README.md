# Recommendation-System-using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to create a recommedation system which helps users select businesses in order to maximize their profits. There are a couple of approaches used in this project which includes both machine learning and non-machine learning based techniques. 

The first is a deep learning based approach which uses a Matrix Factorization based model in order to perform recommendations. The code is written in Python and it uses the Keras library for development of the neural network. 

The second is a collaborative filering based appraoch. This includes both user based and item based collaborative filtering techniques implemented. Both these methods are written in python with the help of Apache Spark Framework for faster processing. This also includes a Matrix Factorization based implementation using the Spark MLib library.
